bios loads to 0x7c00


x86 starts in 16 bit real mode, which needs to use the segment registers to address more than 64k mem
a physical address is generated by (segment register *0x10) + address.
There are diff seg registers for diff things CS,DS,SS,ES,FS,GS. Some opcodes use certain segment registers.

e.g
mov bx, 0x7c0
mov ds, bx ; can't assign ds directly
mov al, [0xa] ; actually loads value at physical address (0x7c0 * 0x10) + 0xa (ie 0x7c0a)
